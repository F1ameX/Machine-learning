# Titanic Kaggle Project

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The project uses the dataset provided by the Kaggle Titanic competition.

## Project Structure

- `Titanic_Kaggle/`
    - `data/`: Contains the Titanic dataset.
    - `sample.ipynb/`: Saved machine learning model.
    - `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**
    - Load the Titanic dataset.
    - Analyze the dataset to understand the structure and relationships.
    - Visualize key features and their distributions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Handle missing values in the dataset.
    - Engineer new features to improve model performance.

3. **Model Training**
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Train Catboost Classifier  machine learning model.

4. **Model Evaluation**
    - Evaluate models using accuracy.

5. **Prediction**
    - Use the selected model to make predictions on the test dataset.
    - Prepare the submission file for the Kaggle competition.

## Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of 78% on the test dataset. The performance can be further improved by experimenting with different feature engineering techniques and advanced machine learning models.

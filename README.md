# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my first small pet projects in Machine Learning, focusing on both classical ML techniques and Computer Vision (CV). Each project demonstrates practical applications of ML concepts and algorithms.

## Projects

1. **Box-office Prediction (Kaggle)**  
2. **Digit Recognition**  
3. **Titanic Survival Prediction (Kaggle)**  
4. **Wine Quality Analysis (Kaggle)**  
5. **Color Detection CV**  
6. **Face Detection CV**  
7. **Binary Prediction of Poisonous Mushrooms (Kaggle competition)**  
8. **Nepali Number Plate Classification CV**  
9. **Dog/cat Classification CV**  
10. **Welding Defect Detection CV**  
11. **Bone Fracture Detection CV**  
12. **Self Car Detection CV**

## Usage
Each project folder contains Jupyter notebooks showcasing data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The repository also includes Computer Vision projects for object detection, classification, and more.
